SMFCF    =   0.203  !  soil moisture content at field capacity [cm3/cm3]
SM0      =   0.300  !  soil moisture content at saturation [cm3/cm3]

CRAIRC   =   0.100  ! critical soil air content for aeration [cm3/cm3]

** percolation parameters
K0       =  50.0  ! hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil [cm day-1]
SOPE     =  50.0   ! maximum percolation rate root zone[cm day-1]
KSUB     =  50.0   ! maximum percolation rate subsoil [cm day-1]

** soil workability parameters
